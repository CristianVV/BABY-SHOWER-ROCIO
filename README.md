## 🤖 Agentic Workflow (READ THIS FIRST)

This project follows an **Agentic-First** development approach.

### If you are an AI / Agent:
1.  **READ `CLAUDE.md` FIRST**. This is your primary source of truth for context, rules, and architecture.
2.  **CHECK `TASKS.md`**. This tracks the current state of the project and what needs to be done next.
3.  **UPDATE DOCUMENTATION**. You **MUST** document any significant changes in `CLAUDE.md` and update `TASKS.md` as you work.

### If you are a Human:
1.  **SETUP**: Read [`INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed setup and deployment guides.
2.  **CONTEXT**: Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) to understand the architectural decisions and rules.
3.  **Tasks**: Check [`TASKS.md`](./TASKS.md) to see what the agents have been up to.
